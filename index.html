            "They are carnivorous and primarily feed on fish, birds, and mammals. Some larger species can take down large prey, including wildebeests and buffalo.",
            "Crocodiles communicate using a variety of vocalizations, including hissing, growling, and even bellowing, especially during mating season.",
            "Unlike many reptiles, female crocodiles exhibit parental care, guarding their nests and helping hatchlings reach the water.",
            "There are 15 recognized species of true crocodiles, including the Nile crocodile, saltwater crocodile, and American crocodile.",
            "Crocodiles can live for several decades, with some species known to live over 70 years in the wild.",
